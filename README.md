My Project
Food Trucks Nearby is an application that shows nearby food trucks and relevant information. Users will be able to view information for food trucks nearby, change their selection by city, and search for specific queries such as tacos. Additionally, users will be able to login or register to make use of a favorites feature for saving their favorite food trucks. Information provided will include the food truck name, hours, location, additional links, and mapping.


Assignment Overview
The goal of this project is for you to design, develop, test, and deploy your own web application. You will generate the idea for your application. You will design, and implement, its components (i.e., user interface, data model, database, service architecture), its development plan, and its deployment procedure. Demonstration of these abilities indicates your mastery of developing a software artifact.

Please note, the capstone is designed to be a web application which means there is interactivity with the user.   The capstone needs to be much more than just a static website or a dynamic website that just displays data from a database.   The user must be able to do something with your web application.

This project is due at the end of the course. There will be many milestones and check-ins along the way, but by the end of 8 weeks it is expected you have a working web application.

 

Capstone Project Requirements
You are to design, develop, and deploy a web application. What the application does, or what it is used for, is up to you. It could be a game (e.g., the Spaceman game where you guess letters), a CRUD application for a common storage problem (e.g., a customer contact tracker where you input and retrieve customer interactions), or another type of application you conceive. What matters is that the context of the application is useful or meaningful to you. You are welcome to discuss and solicit ideas from your peers, but please note that your final application idea, and a description of the Minimum Viable Product, will need to be approved by the instructor.

For the purposes of this project, your web application will consist of at least three architecture components:

User Interface
Database
Service Layer(s)
